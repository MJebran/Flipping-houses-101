Add this using statement to the top of your file

using System.Text.Json;


Then you can serialize that list into a json document

var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(accounts);


Then save that json document to a file

File.WriteAllText("accounts.json", json);


In another place in your program (maybe at the beginning of the program when you're first starting up) you can read that file back in

var json = File.ReadAllText("accounts.json");


and convert that json back into a list of accounts

var newListOfAccounts = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Account>>(json);
